## Goal
Explain multi-level models from the ground up in a way that is rigorous but still intuitive.

## Core topics
- generative story
- pooling vs partial pooling vs no pooling
- priors on group effects and shrinkage behavior
- how uncertainty propagates

## Why it’s useful
This is the modeling pattern behind a lot of “serious” inference in messy real-world data.
