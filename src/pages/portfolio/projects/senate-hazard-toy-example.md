## What this demonstrates
A minimal, understandable example of discrete-time hazard modeling:
- define time steps (weeks/months)
- define risk sets and event indicators
- build features that evolve over time
- fit and interpret hazard probabilities

## Why it matters
It’s a clean way to model “risk of event over time,” and it scales naturally to real pipelines.
