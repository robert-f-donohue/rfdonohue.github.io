I’m **Robert Donohue** — a data scientist and sustainability professional focused on **building decarbonization**. I’m the **Co-Founder & CTO of Enverdex**, where I lead development of **Praevion**, an optimization engine that helps building owners identify retrofit pathways that balance **cost, carbon, and performance**—and translate that into decision-ready recommendations.

I’m also completing a **Master’s in Data Science at Tufts University**, with an emphasis on **Bayesian methods, statistical modeling, and optimization**. This site is where I publish the thinking behind what I’m building—technical deep dives, project notes, and lessons learned moving from research concepts to production software.

## What I’m building at Enverdex

At Enverdex, my work spans the full stack of a modern technical product:

- **Optimization & ML:** multi-objective optimization, surrogate modeling, and uncertainty-aware decision support
- **Energy modeling workflows:** OpenStudio / EnergyPlus pipelines and simulation orchestration
- **Product engineering:** building data ingestion → KPI evaluation → recommendations → user-facing tooling
- **Investor-grade clarity:** turning complex tradeoffs into simple outputs that support action

## Experience in sustainability + analytics

In parallel with Enverdex, I work on applied sustainability and analytics—supporting retrofit planning and portfolio strategy, including **operational vs embodied carbon tradeoffs**, and **financial exposure analysis** under emerging building performance regulations.

## What you’ll find on this site

I write for technical readers (founders, engineers, researchers, and climate-tech investors) who want substance:

- **Bayesian modeling** in real workflows (not just theory)
- **Optimization systems** that survive constraints, noise, and messy inputs
- **Energy modeling + data science** as one integrated engineering problem
- Notes from projects I’m shipping, experiments I’m running, and research I’m translating into product

## Topics I’m most excited about

- Multi-objective optimization for real-world design decisions
- Decision-making under uncertainty (Bayesian thinking in production)
- Scaling simulation-driven workflows with practical software engineering
- Building decarbonization: cost, carbon, and feasibility—together
